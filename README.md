This is a memory game where you press the cards to reveal the pictures and match the pairs of pictures.  It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### How to use it

Simply click the link to play the deployed version of the website.  Pick a card and try to guess the location of its match.  If you guess wrong, you will see what both of your choices were before they are hidden again.  If you guess correctly, they will stay revealed.

### If there are any issues
